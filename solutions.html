          <h6>Original quote from | 原文引自: <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-climate-change-policies-environmental-degradation">China’s Fight Against Climate Change and Environmental Degradation</a><h6>
          <h2>What is China doing to reduce its emissions?</h2>
          <p>President Xi Jinping has recognized climate change as one of his administration’s top concerns, and Beijing has made a variety of pledges to address it. These include:
          <ul>
            <li>achieving carbon neutrality by 2060;</li>
            <li>reaching peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030;</li>
            <li>having renewable energy sources account for 25 percent of total energy consumption by 2030; </li>
            <li>reducing carbon intensity, or the amount of carbon emitted per unit of GDP, by more than 65 percent by 2030;</li>
            <li>installing enough solar and wind power generators to have a combined capacity of 1.2 billion kilowatts by 2030; and,
          boosting forest coverage by around six billion cubic meters by 2030.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>However, experts say many of these goals aren’t ambitious enough...

          <h2>How has China cooperated with the rest of the world on climate change?</h2>
          <p>China only recently started actively helping to formulate global responses to climate change. For decades, China resisted making commitments under the UN framework. Chinese diplomats argued that China shouldn’t have to sacrifice its economic development for environmental protection and that developed countries, such as the United States, should carry more of the burden because they were able to grow their economies without limitations.

          <h3>Trace the History</h3>
          <h4>Timeline: UN Climate Talks</h4>
          <p>As climate change and environmental degradation became a top priority for the Chinese government, it participated more in global climate talks, eventually becoming “a leader on climate change,” write CFR Fellows Yanzhong Huang and Joshua Kurlantzick. In 2016, China announced its participation in the Paris Agreement, and in the years since, it has ramped up its commitments.

          <p>China has been open to working with other countries. Environmental ministers from Japan and South Korea, whose governments have expressed concerns about smog and acid rain that crosses their countries’ borders from China, have held yearly meetings with their Chinese counterparts. The European Union agreed to support China’s implementation of its emissions trading scheme. India, the world’s third-largest emitter, has signed climate agreements with China, but heightened tensions in 2020–21 raised doubts about future collaboration.

          <h4>Have China and the United States worked together?</h4>
          <p>Despite deep-seated political and economic tensions, the rivals have worked together in the past and experts see opportunities for future cooperation. Under the Barack Obama administration, the countries expanded collaboration among Chinese and American companies, scientists, and experts on clean energy and carbon-capture technologies. In 2014, they jointly announced commitments to reduce emissions. 

          <p>Much of that cooperation stopped under President Donald Trump, who took a confrontational stance toward Beijing and questioned the science of climate change. 

          <p>President Joe Biden, who has committed to reducing U.S. emissions and restoring American leadership on climate change, has said engagement with China is essential. In April 2021, during a visit to Shanghai by Biden’s climate envoy, John Kerry, the two countries agreed to make more ambitious pledges under the Paris accord. Days later, Xi participated in a U.S.-hosted virtual climate summit. At the same time, the Biden administration has emphasized competition with Beijing, including aims to boost U.S. clean energy industries in response to China’s dominance in that area.
